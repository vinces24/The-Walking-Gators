# The-Walking-Gators

To run the code, create a project in CLion containing the Graph.H and main.cpp files. Following this, move nodes.txt and ConnectedPaths.txt into the cmake-build-debug folder. From here, the program should run properly, and you must insert two Node ids when prompted in the terminal. The node should be found from openstreetmap.org, and should be a node chosen in a walkable area on the UF Campus and surrounding areas.
